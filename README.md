# Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structures

The prediction of protein structure is one of the most important challenges in bioinformatics. For this reason, for some years the soft computing technologies are emerging as good candidates for the solution of this type of NP-complete problems. This research presents an exploratory analysis and the prediction of the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) of a decoy set with size ranging from zero to twenty one Ångströms. With this jupyter notebook we hope that problem statement for these type of data sets be clearest and provide to lectors a better understanding about protein tertiary structures, data analysis of physicochemical properties and regression models for RMSD prediction.
